            In 1999, Bishop Jean Williams saw hungry families in her Bridgeport
            neighborhood and asked her daughter, Mary Green, for help. That simple request
            sparked a partnership with Connecticut Foodshare and grew into Park City
            Initiative — an organization now distributing over one million meals a year.
