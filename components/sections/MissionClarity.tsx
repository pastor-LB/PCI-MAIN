            Food insecurity in Bridgeport is rarely an isolated problem — it&apos;s tangled
            up with the cycles of poverty, instability, and lost opportunity that keep
            families from moving forward. That&apos;s why Park City Initiative pairs
            emergency food assistance with youth development and community leadership
            training, addressing today&apos;s hunger while building tomorrow&apos;s
            resilience.

            Our vision is a Bridgeport where every child has the support to dream big,
            every senior is cared for, and every block has neighbors looking out for one
            another.
