            <p>
              In 1999, Bishop Jean Williams made a simple request to her daughter, Mary Green:
              <span className="font-semibold text-brand-charcoal"> "Help me feed the hungry families in our city."</span>
              That conversation sparked a movement that has transformed Bridgeport.
            </p>
            <p>
              What began as one woman's compassion for her neighbors has grown into a comprehensive,
              multi-program organization serving thousands of families annually. From the Bishop Jean Williams
              Food Pantry to youth development programs like S.C.A.M.P. and Kidz Academy, to community
              transformation through Adopt-A-Block initiatives—Park City Initiative has become a
              <span className="font-semibold text-brand-charcoal"> trusted cornerstone of Bridgeport's social fabric.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we serve 900+ families every week, distribute 1 million+ meals annually,
              provide education and mentorship to hundreds of young people, and actively transform
              entire city blocks through volunteer action. Yet our mission remains unchanged:
              <span className="font-semibold text-brand-purple"> to meet basic needs today, restore hope for tomorrow,
              and transform lives forever.</span>
